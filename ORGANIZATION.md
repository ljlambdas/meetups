# Narrate the meetup

* [ ] Come to Poligon 20 minutes before the start of the meetup.
* [ ] Open up the Meetup.com event page on the projector so that new people know they are in the right place.
* [ ] Decide on a provisional date for next meetup.
* [ ] Ask each speaker for a sentence or two about who they are and what they do. Tell them you need this so you can introduce them.
* [ ] Coordinate with speakers who will go first.
* [ ] The schedule is normally something along these lines. Feel free to improvise:
  * [ ] "Raise hand if you are new to this meetup".
  * [ ] "Raise hand if you are new to functional programming".
  * [ ] Introduce speaker 1.
  * [ ] Take a photo during talk 1.
  * [ ] Introduce speaker 2.
  * [ ] Take a photo during talk 2.
  * [ ] Thank speakers.
  * [ ] "We need talks: beginners welcome! web, mobile, desktop, embedded, big data, everything goes!"
  * [ ] "Provisional date for next meetup, raise hands".
  * [ ] "Raise hands who is looking for work? Stand up who is hiring? Mingle!"
