# Lambdas Meetups in Ljubljana

A somewhat regular get-together of functional programmers from around Ljubljana, Slovenia, with a talk or two, sometimes a [Lightning Talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) session, followed by discussions afterwards. Non-slovenian-speaking attendees welcome as most of the talks are in English!
